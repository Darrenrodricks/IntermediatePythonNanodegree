# Intro To Python (Udemy)
**These are a few notes and programs that I have written while working on the "Intro to Python Course" on Udemy**

**CHAPTER 1: [Representing Data](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntermediatePythonNanodegree/tree/main/RepresentingData)** 
  *This chapter introduced the basics, mostly review and ended up proving to be useful as itwas a good refresher and great way to begin course*
  
  
**CHAPTER 2: [Functions and Functional Programming](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntermediatePythonNanodegree/tree/main/FunctionsAndFunctionalProgramming)**
*This chapter deals with functions and modules, used a lot more complex functions to create powerful codes that were a lot more complicated than what I was typically used to.*


**CHAPTER 3: [Object Oriented Programming](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntermediatePythonNanodegree/tree/main/ObjectOrientedProgramming)**
*This was a review of objkect oriented programming but went more into depth abouut terms like getters and setters, was complicated at first but proved to be great practice overall*

**CHAPTER 4: [File I/O](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntermediatePythonNanodegree/tree/main/IntermediateFileIO)**
*This chapter deals with reading and writing files, this taugh me the basics and then also went more in detail talking about the different styles of reading and writing files uusing notation such as comma-separated values and Javascript Object Notation*

**CHAPTER 5: [Foundations](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntermediatePythonNanodegree/tree/main/Foundations)**
*This chapter covers design patterns to write clear code, more object oriented programming and more documentational work. There is also lessons about web content to build advanced programs and also how bigger data sets can be sorted and made useful through different styles of code.*
