# Intro To Python (Udemy)
**These are a few notes and programs that I have written while working on the "Intro to Python Course" on Udemy**

**CHAPTER 1: [Representing Data](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntermediatePythonNanodegree/tree/main/RepresentingData)** 
  *This chapter introduced the basics, mostly review and ended up proving to be useful as itwas a good refresher and great way to begin course*
  
  
**CHAPTER 2: [Functions and Functional Programming](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntermediatePythonNanodegree/tree/main/FunctionsAndFunctionalProgramming)**
*This chapter deals with functions and modules, used a lot more complex functions to create powerful codes that were a lot more complicated than what I was typically used to.*


**CHAPTER 3: [Object Oriented Programming](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntermediatePythonNanodegree/tree/main/ObjectOrientedProgramming)**
*This was a review of objkect oriented programming but went more into depth abouut terms like getters and setters, was complicated at first but proved to be great practice overall*

**CHAPTER 4: [File I/O](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/IntermediatePythonNanodegree/tree/main/IntermediateFileIO)**
*This was a review of objkect oriented programming but went more into depth abouut terms like getters and setters, was complicated at first but proved to be great practice overall*

### Will upload part 2 of course by end of day on July 24, 2021
